Team 8's Vision Programs
======

The Java program is a prototype for detecting the hot goal in 2014's game, Aerial Assist. It is not ever going to be used.

The C++ program using OpenCV is a work in progress for detecting yellow totes in 2015's game, Recycle Rush. It is meant to be offloaded to the Raspberry Pi whenever that gets finished.
